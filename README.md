Some of my AngelScript plugins for Sven Co-op.

* The folder `mirror` is where I will put plugins of other authors, those who don't seem to be hosted anywhere aynmore and were lost with the removal of the removal of the SC forums
* The plugins in the folder `twlz` are twilightzone server specific and can't/should'nt be used (without modifications) but might be interesting for reference

## Places of Sven Co-op plugins from other authors
As the forums are gone and there is no central plugin registry, most plugin are scattered around the web, hence this list to at least have a bit of a entry point to find plugins. General rule of thumb: Also check the other repositories of the linked users, there might be more Sven Co-op plugin repos or other related stuff. Pull requests welcome.
